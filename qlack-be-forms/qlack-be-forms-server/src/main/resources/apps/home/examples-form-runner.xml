        Create forms with Form Builder, the Orbeon Forms visual form designer. It allows you to build and deploy forms
        in minutes right from your web browser. Add form fields, including rich controls such as date, currency,
        file attachments and more. Group your fields in sections. Define validation logic, visibility rules, initial
        values. Pre-populate fields from Web or REST services. And there is more!

        considering to create forms by writing XForms by hand, see
